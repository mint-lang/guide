# Control Expressions

In Mint, control structures are expressions that return a value, so they are called **control expressions**.

Here are the control expressions:

* **if...else** - basic, 2 way conditional expression
* **case** - extended, N-way conditional expression
* **try** - executes a sequence of **synchronous** expressions, including failure handling
* **sequence** - executes **asynchronous** expressions in sequence, including failure handling
* **parallel** - executes **asynchronous** expressions in parallel, including failure handling
