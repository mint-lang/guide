# Configuration

Your application / package is configured with the `mint.json` file \(which is a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file\).

The initial `mint.json` file of an application looks like this:

```text
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "source-directories": [
    "source"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "mint-core": {
      "repository": "https://github.com/mint-lang/mint-core",
      "constraint": "0.0.0 <= v < 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
All the fields are validated so if something is not right you will get a nice error message!
{% endhint %}

Here are all the possible fields \(dot notation denotes a nested object\):

| Path | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| name | The name of your application or package. |
| source-directories | The directories which contains source files of your application. |
| test-directories | The directories which contains tests for your application. |
| dependencies | Contains the dependencies. |
| application | Contains application specific information \(can be omitted in packages\) |
| application.head | A path to an HTML file which can contain links to external resources. |
| application.title | The initial title of the application. |
| application.meta | An object which contains informations which is converted to META tags. |
| application.icon | A path to an image file which is converted to different icons like [favicons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon). |
| application.orientation | \[PWA\] The orientation of the application, either "portrait" or "landscape". |
| application.name | \[PWA\] The name of the application. |
| application.theme-color | \[PWA\] The theme color of the application. |
| application.display | \[PWA\] The display property of the application, one of: "fullscreen", "standalone", "minimal-ui", "browser" |
| formatter-config.indent-size | Specifies how many spaces is used to intend code locks. |

## Dependencies

The dependencies object contains all the packages that your application needs. Each key is the name of a package and the value is an object that has a `repository` field pointing to Git repository and `constraint` field that is the version information in one of two formats:

* `0.0.0 <= v < 1.0.0` where the `v` is the resolvable version
* `master:1.0.0` where the first part is the Git reference \(of a branch, commit hash or tag\) followed by a colon and the version the package should resolve as this is necessary because the version is only specified by tags.
